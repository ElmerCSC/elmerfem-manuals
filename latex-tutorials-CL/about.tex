\chapter*{Elmer non-GUI Tutorials}

\section*{About this document}

The Elmer non-GUI Tutorials is part of the documentation of Elmer finite element software.
Elmer non-GUI Tutorials gives examples on the use of Elmer in different fields
of continuum physics. Also coupled problems are included. 

These tutorials were written before ElmerGUI was written (i.e. before year 2008) and 
they don't make use of it. 
See the Elmer GUI Tutorials for information how to set up the cases using ElmerGUI.
These cases are not really that well fitted as tutorials for beginners but they may be useful 
for power users who want to understand more deeply how models in Elmer are set up. 

The present manual corresponds to Elmer software version~\elmerversion{}.

Latest documentations and program versions of Elmer are available (or links are provided) at
