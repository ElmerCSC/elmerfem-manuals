\chapter*{Instructions for the Elmer tutorials using ElmerGUI}

Here are some instructions for following the Elmer tutorials:
\begin{itemize}
\item All of the needed geometry input files should be available among 
the \texttt{ElmerGUI/samples} directory that should have come with the 
Elmer installation. Look under a subdirectory named after the suffix of the sample file.  
%
\item The instructions written in \texttt{verbatim} refer to operations 
  with the GUI. Indentation means step in the menu hierarchy. 
  The ElmerGUI instructions should not be mixed with the statements in 
the .sif command file. 
%
\item The menu structure for the default set of equations is located 
  in directory \texttt{edf}, there are a few additional ones in 
  directory \texttt{edf-extra}. These may be copied to the directory \texttt{edf}
  permanently, or may be appended to the menus while running the ElmerGUI. 
%
\item The default menu structure may differ from the configuration used
  when writing the tutorial. Hence the user is encouraged to check by herself 
  whether the menu structure needed for a particular tutorial has been loaded 
into ElmerGUI. 
%
\item After having once defined the case in ElmerGUI you may go to the 
working directory and launch ElmerSolver from command-line. There you 
may manually edit the .sif file using a text editor to alter the parameters.
%
\item Manual alteration to the .sif file will not be communicated to the
  ElmerGUI project. All edits or changes will be overwritten by ElmerGUI the 
next time the project is saved.  Copy the manually altered .sif files to another
folder or change the name of the .sif file, to prevent losing your edits.
%
\item It is assumed that the default method for visualization is Paraview (or ElmerVTK) 
using \texttt{.vtu} format.  \texttt{ElmerPost} that uses the \texttt{.ep} 
format is no longer available in most installations.  Unfortunately, not all of the tutorials 
currently use Paraview for visualization.
  
\item Since ElmerGUI v. 9.0 the ElmerVTK widget that comes built into ElmerGUI has 
been upgraded to use \texttt{.vtu} files. ElmerVTK may be an ideal visualization 
tool for most straight-forward demonstrations, since it is easy to use.  More 
complicated applications, such as animation of transient studies, may require the 
use of Paraview.  Regardless of which post processing visualization tool is used, the
construction of an ElmerGUI project remains the same for both.
%
\item These cases have been run a number of times but errors are still possible.
  Reporting them to elmeradm@csc.fi, for example, is greatly appreciated.
