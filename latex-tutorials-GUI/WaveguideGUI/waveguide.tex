\subsection*{Case definition}

In this tutorial we model propagation of a guided wave through a bend in a rectangular
waveguide.  Let us choose the primary wave to be a $TE_{10}$ mode at $f=2.5~
\mathrm{GHz}$ propagating in the positive $z$ axis direction (time-harmonic
convention $e^{-i\omega t}$).

The electric field of the primary wave is given by
\[ \vec E_p = \vec u_y \frac{ik}{k_c}\sin(k_cx)e^{i\beta z},\]
where $k_c = \pi / a$, $k = \omega \sqrt{\varepsilon_0 \mu_0}$ and $\beta =
\sqrt{k^2-k_c^2}$. The dimensions of the waveguide's cross section are 
$a=10~ \mathrm{cm}$ and $b=5~ \mathrm{cm}$, the bend is a piece of circular
torus with outer radius of $12~ \mathrm{cm}$ and inner radius of $2~
\mathrm{cm}$. The waveguide geometry is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:geometry}.

The input port is that part of the boundary which is normal to $z$ -axis, 
the output port that which is normal to $x$ -axis and the rest of the boundary is
a PEC boundary.

The PEC boundary condition is given by $\vec n \times \vec E = 0$, the
input boundary condition by
\[\vec n \times \nabla \times \vec E - i\beta \vec n \times 
        (\vec n \times \vec E) = i2\beta \vec n \times 
                                     (\vec n \times \vec E_p),\]
and the output boundary condition by
\[\vec n \times \nabla \times \vec E - i\beta \vec n \times (\vec n \times \vec E)=0.\]
Here $\vec n$ is the exterior normal of the domain.

\subsection*{ElmerGUI solution procedure}

The GUI definitions of VectorHelmholtz solver utilized in this tutorial are located in the \texttt{edf-extra} folder and thus need to be manually activated
in the ElmerGUI as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
File
  Definitions
    Append -> vectorhelmholtz.xml
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{vectorhelmholtz.xml} definition file is, by default, located in\\
\texttt{\$ELMER\_HOME/share/ElmerGUI/edf-extra}.

Load geometry:
\begin{verbatim}
File
  Open -> waveguide_bend.step
\end{verbatim}

As we are modeling a wave phenomenon at $2.5 \mathrm{GHz}$ the
maximum H in the mesh must be around $\frac 1 {10\lambda}$, where
$\lambda\approx8.3$:
\begin{verbatim}
Mesh
  Configure..
    Max H: 0.012
    Apply
Mesh
  Remesh
\end{verbatim}

Add the \texttt{VectorHelmholtz} and \texttt{VectorHelmholtzCalcFields}
solver modules:
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Equation -> Add..
    Vector Helmholtz Post Process
      Active = on
      Priority 4
    Result Output
      Active = on
      Priority 2
    Vector Helmholtz Equation
      Active = on
      Apply to Bodies: Body 1
      Angular Frequency = $ 2*pi*2.5e9
      Priority 5
      Free text input
        $ a = 10e-2
        $ b = 5e-2
        $ c0 = 1/sqrt(8.854e-12*4*pi*10^-7)
        $ omega=2*pi*2.5e9
        $ k0 = omega/c0
        $ kc = pi/a
        $ beta0 = sqrt(k0^2-kc^2)
      Edit Solver Settings
        Linear system
          Iterative = BiCGStabl
          Preconditioning = vanka
          BiCGStabl order = 6
          Convergence tol = 1e-6
          Apply
      Add
    OK
\end{verbatim}

Here in the \texttt{Free text input} part we defined some constants that
will make definition of the rest of the model easier.

Then add boundary PEC conditions:
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Boundary Condition -> Add..
  Name = PEC
  VectorHelmholtz Equation
    E re {e} = 0
    E im {e} = 0
    Apply to boundaries = 2...13
    Add
  OK
\end{verbatim}

Note that because the mesh is tetrahedral, the \texttt{E re/im \{f\}}
Dirichlet condition is unnecessary. The hexahedral and pyramidal Piola
transformed elements have DOFs on element faces rendering
the \texttt{\{f\}} Dirichlet conditions meaningful.

Add the input port boundary condition:
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Boundary Condition -> Add..
  Name = Inport
  Apply to boundaries = 14
  VectorHelmholtz Equation
    Magnetic Boundary Load 2 [enter]
      Variable Coordinate 1
      Real MATC "-2*beta0*k0/kc*sin(kc*(tx+a/2))"
      Close
    Electric Robin Coefficient im = $ beta0
  Add
  OK
\end{verbatim}

Next add the output port boundary
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Boundary Condition -> Add..
  Name = Outport
  Apply to boundaries = 1
  VectorHelmholtz Equation
    Electric Robin Coefficient im = $ beta0
  Add
  OK
\end{verbatim}

Assign material to the body
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Material -> Add..
  Apply to bodies: Body 1
  Inverse Relative Permeability = 1
  Relative Permittivity = 1
  Add
  OK
\end{verbatim}

Now navigate to choose what results are to be saved:
\begin{verbatim}
Model
  Equation -> Equation 1
  Vector Helmholtz Post Process
    Edit Solver Settings
      Solver specific options
        Calculate Electric Field = on
        Calculate Magnetic Field Strength = on
        Calculate Poynting Vector = on
        Calculate Energy Functional = on
        Apply
      Update
      OK
\end{verbatim}

Save the project
\begin{verbatim}
File
  Save project -> [choose location]
\end{verbatim}

And solve:
\begin{verbatim}
Run
  Start Solver
\end{verbatim}

The resulting fields should now appear in \texttt{case0001.vtu} file ready for
further post processing.

\subsection*{Results}
We are interested in the \texttt{Energy Functional Value} in the solver
log. It should read (prepended with ``\texttt{VectorHelmholtzSolver:}'')

\small{
\begin{verbatim}
Energy Functional value:  -11284.937620324963        453999.53923919413
\end{verbatim}
}

The first number is the real part and second the imaginary part.
Denoting this with $l(E)$ it holds that in this case
\[l(E) = \frac {i \beta k_0^2
ab}{\mu k_c^2} (1+\rho),\] where $\rho$ is the reflection coefficient of
electric field. Thus $\rho\approx-0.022+0.024i$, which translates to roughly $29.7~\mathrm{dB}$ return loss.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:solution} the Poynting vector and the real part of the
electric field of the solution field is shown.
