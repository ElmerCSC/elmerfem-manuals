The Elmer GUI Tutorials is part of the documentation of Elmer finite element software.
Elmer GUI Tutorials gives examples on the use of Elmer in different fields
of continuum physics. Also coupled problems are included. 

All these tutorials assume the use of ElmerGUI, the graphical user interface of 
Elmer. There are also older tutorials in the Elmer non-GUI Tutorials that 
may be useful for power users who want to understand more deeply 
how models in Elmer are set up.

The present manual corresponds to Elmer software version~\elmerversion{}.

Latest documentations and program versions of Elmer are available (or links are provided) at
