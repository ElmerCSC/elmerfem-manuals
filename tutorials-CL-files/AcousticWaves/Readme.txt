As ElmerFront is since long obsolete this test case
has been pushed to be done without it. Look at files
domain.grd and helmholtz-new.sif to perform the case with ElmerGrid.
Note that we haven't really produced case with 1-to-1 correspondence. 


Update, while converting AcousticWaves to ElmerGUI, it was necessary to run the tutorial using ElmerFront.  Loaded Elmer 6.2 with  a working ElmerFront and ran the tutorial, using the original geometry.  Results from ElmerPost are included, namely Pressure-1 and Pressure-2.
