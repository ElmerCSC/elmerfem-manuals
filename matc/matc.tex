\section{Introduction}
MATC is a library for the numerical evaluation of mathematical expressions. In the Elmer 
package it can be used in defining expressions in the command file of ElmerSolver. The expressions
may be evaluated either while the command file is read in, or at the time of execution.
MATC may also be used in the command window of ElmerPost.   


\section{MATC Variables}

There are two types of variables in MATC: matrices and strings. 
Both are actually stored the same way in a double precision array, so that storing large arrays of strings is wasteful sizewise. 

A variable is created by assigning value to it: 
\[
  x = 1. 
\]
 
The above statement creates a $1 \times 1$ matrix whose name is x. 

The statement 
\[
  k = ``hello''
\]
 creates a $1 \times 5$ string variable k. That is, string variables are created with enclosed in ''''-marks. 

Variables can be indexed by two row vectors. The statement 
\[
   x(0,0:5) = x(0,5:0)
\]
reverses the order of the first six elements of the first row of a variable called $x$. 
Indexing thus begins from zero. 

Yet one example of creating a variable (or affecting its values) is 
\[
  x(0:9) = 1 2 3 4
\]
 Variable $x$ will be a $1 \times 10$ matrix, if not previously created and bigger. 
It's elements are 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2.
The example shows that you don't have to give the row index if it's zero, and that when scanning for values for elements, the values end, they are repeated from the beginning. 

Size of the variables are dynamic. If variable $x$ is non-existent the statement 
\[
  x(9,9) = 1
\]
creates a new matrix whose size is $10 \times 10$ and is zero except for the last element whose value is 1. 

Another way of indexing a matrix is logical expression whose size is the same as the matrix which is being indexed. The statement 
\[
  x(x < 0.05) = 0.05
\]
sets the values of matrix x which are less than 0.05 to the value 0.05. 



\section{MATC general flow control structures}

The syntax of the flow control structures of MATC are given below. 
\ttbegin
if ( expr ) expr; else expr;
if ( expr )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
} else {
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}

for( i=vector ) expr;
for( i=vector )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}

while( expr ) expr;
while( expr )
{
    expr;
    ...
    expr;
}
\ttend



\section{MATC Operators}

Assume the following definitions:
\begin{itemize}
\item a,b and c ordinary matrices  
\item l,t and r logical matrices 
\item s,n and m scalars 
\end{itemize}

\sifbegin
\ttitem{b=a' } is transpose of matrix a. 
\ttitem{b=@a} evaluate content of a string variable a as a MATC statement. 
\ttitem{t=$\sim$l} elementwise logical not of  if x is not zero. 
\ttitem{b=a$\hat{ }$s} if a is a square matrix and s is integral, a matrix power is computed, otherwise an elementwise power. 
\ttitem{c=a*b} if a and b are compatible for matrix product, that is computed, 
otherwise if they are of the same size or at least one of them is scalar, an elementwise product is computed. 
\ttitem{c=a\#b}elementwise multiplication of a and b.  
\ttitem{c=a/b} is fraction of a and b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{c=a+b} is sum of matrices a and b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{c=a-b} is difference of matrices a and b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{l=a==b} equality of matrices a and b elementwise.  
\ttitem{l=a<>b} inequality of matrices a and b elementwise.  
\ttitem{l=a<b} true if a is less than b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{l=a>b} true if a is greater than b computed elementwise.
\ttitem{l=a<=b} true if a is less than or equal to b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{l=a>=b} true if a is greater than or equal to b computed elementwise. 
\ttitem{a=n:m} return a vector of values starting from n and ending to m by increment of (plus-minus) one.  
\ttitem{r=l\&t} elementwise logical and of a and b. 
\ttitem{l=a$|$b} elementwise logical or of a and b. 
\ttitem{c=a?b} reduction: set values of a where b is zero to zero. 
\ttitem{b=n m \% a} resize a to matrix of size n by m. 
\ttitem{b=a} assing a to b. 
\sifend


\section{MATC Function Statement}


The syntax of the function definition is given below. 

\ttbegin
function name(arg1,arg2,...)
!
! Optional function description (seen with help("name"))
!
import var1,var2
export var3,var4
{
    expr;
     ...
    expr;

    \_name = value
}
\ttend

Functions have their own list of variables. Global variables are not seen in this 
function unless imported by import or given as arguments. Local variables can be made global by the export statement. 

Functions, if returing matrices, behave in many ways as variables do. So if you have defined function mult as follows 
\ttbegin
function mult(a,b)
{
   _mult = a*b;
}
\ttend
you can get element (3,5) of the a times b matrix by the following statement 
\ttbegin
mult(x,y)[3,5]
\ttend
or diagonal values of the same matrix by 
\ttbegin
diag(mult(x,y)).
\ttend
