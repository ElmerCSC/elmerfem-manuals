These are the files related to Elmer GUI tutorials.

Note that they may be severely out-dated. Whereas the sif file
and the mesh files are backward compatible, the ElmerGUI project
files most certainly are not!

Note also that the collection of the files is not complete. 

Update in January, 20201:

The tutorial file folders include an ElmerGUI project file, 'egproject.xml', four 'mesh' files, and an (optional) geometry input file.  Some of the folders include a generated 'case.sif' file and an result output file 'case_t0001.vtu'. 

The tutorial file folders have all been updated to work with Elmer version 9.0
